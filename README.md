# My first FullStack App

The backend was made using NodeJS and Express for route handling.
The frontend was made using React and materialUi for styling
MongoDB Atlas was used as the database for this project and Mongoose was used as the ODM - as well as being one of the best enchants in World of Warcraft history, of course.

The main goal is integrating nodeJS and express into my knowledgebase, so the front-end content is mostly placeholder content to further my backend learning.
TODO: refactor the whole thing into Typescript to better adapt to learning curve. 

This project was a lot of fun to do, specifically making the API and seeing the integration between front and backend, and I intend to update this as my backend studies get further along. 
I am very interested in C# in specific, perhaps a C# recreation of this project when I get to that?
